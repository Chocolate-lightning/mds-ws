# Contributing to the Moodle Developer Resources

The Moodle Design System is a MoodleHQ driven project however, we welcome suggestions from anyone who wants to help improve it.

If you plan to contribute, then you may wish to setup a local development
environment to make it easier to do so.

We highly recommend that you read our [TODO: design system contributions guide](#), which includes important information on [TODO: getting started](#getting-started).

For full details and information on how you can contribute to the Moodle Developer Resource project, we recommend taking a look at
our [Contributors guide](https://moodledev.io/general/documentation/contributing).
