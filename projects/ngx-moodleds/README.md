## Introduction

This repository includes the source for the Moodle Design System - a
collection of components and sensible styling defaults aimed at making your life as a Moodle Developer easier.

## Contributing

The Moodle Design System is a MoodleHQ driven project however, we welcome suggestions from anyone who wants to help improve it.

If you plan to contribute, then you may wish to setup a local development
environment to make it easier to do so.

We highly recommend that you read our [TODO: design system contributions guide](#), which includes important information on [TODO: getting started](#getting-started).
