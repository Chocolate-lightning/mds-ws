## Introduction

This repository includes the source for the Moodle Design System - a
collection of components and sensible styling defaults aimed at making your life as a Moodle Developer easier.

## Contributing

The Moodle Design System is a MoodleHQ driven project however, we welcome suggestions from anyone who wants to help improve it.

If you plan to contribute, then you may wish to setup a local development
environment to make it easier to do so.

We highly recommend that you read our [TODO: design system contributions guide](#), which includes important information on [TODO: getting started](#getting-started).

## Installation

TODO: Add instructions for installing the design system locally.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
